#pyidf

Python library to read, modify and create EnergyPlus idf files


**This is a work in progress, do NOT expect it to actually work! As this is an early work, changes in the API are very likely to happen.**

##Todos:

* fields with same name
* field attributes
* read / write support
* handle \note fields as indicated in idd (ignore corresponding objects for the moment?)
* unit tests
